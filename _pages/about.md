Personal Statement
======
I am a undergraudate Y3 student at [BNU-HKBU UIC](https://www.uic.edu.cn/) (known as the Mainland Campus of [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk/)), major in Data Science, Dept. of Stat and DS. 

As a fresh student, I joined the Research Group "Guqin Reduced Character Spectrum Recognition" in [Guangdong Key Laboratory of Data Science and Technology Cross Application](https://irads.uic.edu.cn/), also I joined [Dr. Jiaxin CHEN](https://www.uic.edu.cn/faculty.htm#/jiaxingchen/cn) (Dept. of CS, UIC) group from Oct. 2023 to Jun. 2024, focus using machine learning and deep learning to study cell slices and perform clustering analysis (mostly is Louvain Algorithm).

For intern experience, I jointed Bio-Lab by [Dr. Juile Qiaojin LIN](https://julie-lin-lab.github.io/index.html) (BIRI, HKUST Guangzhou) from Jul.-Sept. 2024 as a intern, primarily focusing on base recognition of electrical signals from third-generation DNA sequencing machines based on deep learning. Meanwhile, I interested in Operation Research, I joined in [Data-driven Smart City-Transportation-Logistics Lab](https://www.sribd.cn/en/znyy/zh-jt) as intern from Oct. 2024-present, following Dean [Dr. Lianmin ZHANG](https://www.sribd.cn/en/teacher/299) (SRIBD & CUHK Shenzhen), conducted customer data analysis for China Mobile (Hong Kong).
